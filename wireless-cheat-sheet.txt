HOW TO GET DEVICES (ie. lo, wlp1s0 e.g.)
  WHAT IS LOCALHOST IP-RANGE (ie. 127.0.0.0-127.254.255.255 [at least by ping])
    WHAT IS WIRELESS AP-CONNECTED LAN IP AS A CLIENT OF THE AP (ie. eg. 192.168.1.42)
      WHAT IS WIRELESS AP-CONNECTED LAN IP RANGE FOR ALL AP CLIENTS (ie. eg. 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.255)

  ip -oneline -brief address


HOW TO GET ACCESS POINT ADDRESS ON THE WIRELESS CARD'S LAN CONNECTION?

  ip route 

  #or even better:
  read mess < <(ip -json route | jq --raw-output '.[]|select(.dst=="192.168.5.0/24" and .dev=="wlP5z2")|"\(.prefsrc) on \(.dev)"'); echo $mess
192.168.1.100 on wlP5z2



#TODO: how do I re-enable IPv6 DNS in /etc/resolv.conf in `nmcli`/NetworkManager as default over IPv4?

dmesg | grep iwlwifi #show possible wireless driver-related debugging information (or `iwevent` to watch)

lshw -C network
lspci | vim - #look up iwlwifi to see if it's loaded by kernel
sudo iw dev #list wireless interfaces
lsmod | vim - #look up iwlwifi to see if it's loaded by kernel
sudo rm /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/* #remove wireless AP stored information
sudo ifconfig wlp1s0 #bring up stats
sudo iw reg get #840 is USA, 00 probably works
sudo nano /etc/defaults/crda #REGDOMAIN=US

#try disabling IPv6 somehow (lol)

sudo modprobe -r ath9k; sleep 3.2s; sudo modprobe ath9k
sudo modprobe -r iwlwifi; sleep 3.2s; sudo modprobe iwlwifi 11n_disable=8
sudo modprobe -r iwlwifi; sleep 3.2s; sudo modprobe iwlwifi 11n_disable=1

#I'm 38% sure this would work when you can scan networks and connect but the connection keeps disconnecting [?]
sudo systemctl restart networking NetworkManager wpa_supplicant systemd-modules-load
