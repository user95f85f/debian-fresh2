#TODO: how do I re-enable IPv6 DNS in /etc/resolv.conf in `nmcli`/NetworkManager as default over IPv4?

dmesg | grep iwlwifi #show possible wireless driver-related debugging information (or `iwevent` to watch)

lshw -C network
lspci | vim - #look up iwlwifi to see if it's loaded by kernel
sudo iw dev #list wireless interfaces
lsmod | vim - #look up iwlwifi to see if it's loaded by kernel
sudo rm /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/* #remove wireless AP stored information
sudo ifconfig wlp1s0 #bring up stats
sudo iw reg get #840 is USA, 00 probably works
sudo nano /etc/defaults/crda #REGDOMAIN=US

#try disabling IPv6 somehow (lol)

sudo modprobe -r ath9k; sleep 3.2s; sudo modprobe ath9k
sudo modprobe -r iwlwifi; sleep 3.2s; sudo modprobe iwlwifi 11n_disable=8
sudo modprobe -r iwlwifi; sleep 3.2s; sudo modprobe iwlwifi 11n_disable=1

#I'm 38% sure this would work when you can scan networks and connect but the connection keeps disconnecting [?]
sudo systemctl restart networking NetworkManager wpa_supplicant systemd-modules-load
